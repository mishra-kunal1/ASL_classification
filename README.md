### Signs Speak Louder Than Words
Developing an Image Recognition Model for American Sign Language (ASL)
The ability to communicate effectively is an essential aspect of human existence, yet it remains a challenge for individuals who
experience hearing or verbal impairments. Fortunately, American Sign Language (ASL) serves as a bridge that connects these individuals 
to the broader society, allowing them to express themselves and establish meaningful connections. 
The aim of the project is to train a model to recognize sign language in real time, using a webcam as the input source. 
This means that when someone signs in front of the webcam, the model can predict which sign they are making
